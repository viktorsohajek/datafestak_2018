# datafestak_2018 Data Science Basics WorkShop
A repository for storing stuff for data science workshop for https://www.datafestak.cz.

# When & Where
The workshop will be held at **08:30-10:00** in room **XXX**. Please get there on time, we'll not wait up.

# Who'll be speaking:
* Viktor Sohajek (Mall Group)
* Hynek Walner (Workday)
* Viktor Brada (Workday)

# About the workshop
The aim of this workshop is to give you a starter kit for modeling using machine learning techniques. After the end of the workshop, you should be able to:
* Understand the concept of train-test dataset split for predictive modeling.
* Build a model on your training data with scikit learn library [Py].
* Use the model to predict values on new predictor data.
* Build some of following models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks.
* Know where to dig further information about DS.

# The workshop will not do:
* Make you instantly DS guru.
* Help you master hyperparameter selection for your kaggle competition.
* Fill your math and stats gaps from college.
* We will not cover clustering methods.

# Prerequisities for the workshop
Before you attend the workshop, make sure, you have grip of:
* installing python packages
* have Python3 installed and ready to use with fresh virtual environment.
* knowledge of how to use jupyter notebooks (setup a new notebook, what is a cell, how do I run/alter it, ...)
* basic understending of concepts: linear regression, derivatives, extremes of analytical functions
* pandas library [Py]: loading data from csv, selecting/altering columns/rows


**If you are not sure, whether the workshop level is optimal for you, just text us on Slack and we will be happy to discuss it with you ;-].**
